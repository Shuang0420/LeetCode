# 101. Symmetric Tree

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree `[1,2,2,3,4,4,3]` is symmetric:

<pre>    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
</pre>

But the following `[1,2,2,null,3,null,3]` is not:  

<pre>    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
</pre>

**Note:**  
Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
