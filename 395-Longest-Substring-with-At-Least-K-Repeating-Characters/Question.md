# 395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-least-k-repeating-characters/)

Find the length of the longest substring **_T_** of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in **_T_** appears no less than _k_ times.

**Example 1:**

<pre>Input:
s = "aaabb", k = 3

Output:
3

The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre>Input:
s = "ababbc", k = 2

Output:
5

The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
</pre>
