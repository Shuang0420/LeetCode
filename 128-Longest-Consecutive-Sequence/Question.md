[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

For example,  
Given `[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`,  
The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Return its length: `4`.

Your algorithm should run in O(_n_) complexity.
