# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:

<pre>A:          a1 → a2
                   ↘
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   ↗            
B:     b1 → b2 → b3
</pre>

begin to intersect at node c1.

**Notes:**

*   If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.
*   The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
*   You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
*   Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.
