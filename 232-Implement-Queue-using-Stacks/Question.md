# 232. Implement Queue using Stacks

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)

Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

*   push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
*   pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
*   peek() -- Get the front element.
*   empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.

**Notes:**  

*   You must use _only_ standard operations of a stack -- which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
*   Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
*   You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).
