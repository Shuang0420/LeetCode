# 74. Search a 2D Matrix

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/)

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an _m_ x _n_ matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

*   Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
*   The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

For example,

Consider the following matrix:

<pre>[
  [1,   3,  5,  7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 50]
]
</pre>

Given **target** = `3`, return `true`.
