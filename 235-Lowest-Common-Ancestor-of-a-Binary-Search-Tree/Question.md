# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/)

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

<pre>        _______6______
       /              \
    ___2__          ___8__
   /      \        /      \
   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
</pre>

For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes `2` and `8` is `6`. Another example is LCA of nodes `2` and `4` is `2`, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
