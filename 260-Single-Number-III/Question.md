# 260. Single Number III

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/)

Given an array of numbers `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

For example:

Given `nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5]`, return `[3, 5]`.

**Note**:  

1.  The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, `[5, 3]` is also correct.
2.  Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?
