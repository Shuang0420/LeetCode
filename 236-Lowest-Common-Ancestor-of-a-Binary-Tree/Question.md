# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

<pre>        _______3______
       /              \
    ___5__          ___1__
   /      \        /      \
   6      _2       0       8
         /  \
         7   4
</pre>

For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes `5` and `1` is `3`. Another example is LCA of nodes `5` and `4` is `5`, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
